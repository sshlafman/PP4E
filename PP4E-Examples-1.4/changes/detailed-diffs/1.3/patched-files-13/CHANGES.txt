----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 1.3, October 19, 2011

Applied 4 PyMailGUI program patches described in the corrections section 
of the book's updates page, at http://www.rmi.net/~lutz/pp4e-updates.html:

1) Non-ASCII filnames support:
   In mailtools (used by PyMailGUI), support i18n attachment filesnames: 
   decode per MIME and email stanadards for displays and saves, and encode
   for sends if non-ASCII per the same standards (just like other headers).

   [File changed: PP4E\Internet\Email\mailtools\mailparser.py]
   [File changed: PP4E\Internet\Email\mailtools\mailsender.py]

2) Delete/Save timing issue fix:
   In PyMailGUI, check for blocking action in progress before verify/select
   dialogs (not after) in Delete/Save callbacks; else action's exit callback
   may change GUI's mail list, invalidate selections, and process wrong mails.

   [File Changed: PP4E\Internet\Email\PyMailGui\ListWindows.py]

3) Better sent-time display:
   In PyMalGUI, use email package tools to display mail sent-time relative 
   to local timezone uniformly; else difficult to tell when mails sent in GUI.

   [File Changed: PP4E\Internet\Email\PyMailGui\ListWindows.py]

4) Demo SMTP port numbers:
   In PyMailGUI, ship new version of mailconfig.py which demonstrates how
   to give a port number for authemticating SMTP mail-send servers.

   [File changed: PP4E\Internet\Email\PyMailGui\mailconfig.py]

--detailed-diffs\1.3\patched-files-13 for source files changed
--detailed-diffs\1.3\patched-files-13\i18N-filenames-test for test files/mails

Also added a new snapshot of the book's support web site files, as of
October 2011, with supplemental examples, Python updates, and book 
notes. See changes\book-web-site\snapshot-oct11\README.txt.

**Source file naming conventions** 

Only the first of the 4 changes above made in this examples release is likely
to be patched in reprints of the book itself; the others' code changes are too
involved.  For reference:

--The original versions of the 2 changed source files whose changes won't appear
in the book were retained, with a "BOOK-" prefix added to their names (e.g., 
PP4E\Internet\Email\PyMailGui\BOOK-ListWindows.py matches this file in the book).  

--The original versions of the 2 files changed for patches that will appear in
reprints are retained as well with a "_PRIOR-" name prefix added (e.g., 
PP4E\Internet\Email\mailtools\_PRIOR-mailparser.py)

Also see the 1.2 release changes below, which include 2 PyMailGUI enhancements
(file closes, server timeouts) which were incorporated into the book itself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 1.2, February 23, 2011

Applied 3 program patches described in the corrections section of the
book's updates page, at http://www.rmi.net/~lutz/pp4e-updates.html#fixes:

1) File close issue fix:
   In PyMailGUI, explicitly close the temporary output file used to
   save HTML-only emails for viewing in a web browser; else, the file
   might not be flushed to disk in time on some (but not all) platforms.

   [File changed: PP4E\Internet\Email\PyMailGui\ListWindows.py]

2) Text editor focus:
   In PyEdit (used by PyMailGUI and other), reset focus to the text widget
   after the Open and Save Unicode encoding promp pop-ups are dismissed; 
   else, users must click in the text area to edit.

   [File changed: PP4E\Gui\TextEditor\textEditor.py]

3) Mail server timeouts:
   In mailtools (used by PyMailGUI), add timeout=N arguments to the POP 
   and SMTP server connect calls; else, clients might hang too long while
   waiting for a dead server to reply, and may need to kill the client.

   [File changed: PP4E\Internet\Email\mailtools\mailFetcher.py]
   [File changed: PP4E\Internet\Email\mailtools\mailSender.py]

See also detailed-diffs\1.2\pp4e-updates-partial.html here for more patch
details, and detailed-diffs\1.2\patched-files-12 for source files changed.

Also added a snapshot of the book's support web site files, as of
February 2011, with supplemental examples, Python updates, and book 
notes. See changes\book-web-site\snapshot-feb11\README.txt.

Release 1.1: November 4, 17, and 19, 2010

Second release, just before publication (during QC1..QC2).  All changes 
listed here were also made in the book itself before its first printing.  
Index:

1) [Ch12] reword echoserver socket example's bind() comment (trivial)
2) [Ch19] remove PyCalc mail file bogus comment (trivial)
3) [Ch13] Patch for Python 3.2: fix_encode_base64 in mailtools package mailsender.py
4) [Ch13, 14] Fix for SMTP pswds: mailtools MailSenderAuth, PyMailGUI WriteWindow
5) [tree] renamed two files from .txt.txt to .txt, tweaked READMEs/top dirs (trivial)
6) [various] fixed typos in code comments of a few examples to match the book (trivial)

================

1) [Ch12] reword echoserver socket example's bind() comment

Reword to clarify that "" means all available interfaces, not just local host.
The book also now explans that this means all local and remote interfaces.

Changed:
myHost = ''     # server machine, '' means local host
To:
myhost = ''     # '' = all available interfaces on host

================

2) [Ch19] remove PyCalc main file bogus comment

Delete bogus comment line about windows.py icon change (it was never made).

Deleted line:
-use windows.py module to get a window icon;

================

3) [Ch13] Patch for Python 3.2: fix_encode_base64 in mailtools package mailsender.py

3A) Decrease indentaton in all lines of this function lines by 1 space (was 5).

3B) Patch to work under Python 3.2 (due out in Jan '11): don't decode new str 
    return type in 3.2, but do decode 3.1's bytes, and do still split lines of 
    base64 data; tested under 3.2 alpha3; replaced 2 lines with 3.

Changed:
bytes = msgobj.get_payload()           # bytes fails in email pkg on text gen
text  = bytes.decode('ascii')          # decode to unicode str so text gen works

To:
text = msgobj.get_payload()            # bytes fails in email pkg on text gen
if isinstance(text, bytes):            # payload is bytes in 3.1, str in 3.2 alpha
    text = text.decode('ascii')        # decode to unicode str so text gen works

3C) [November 17]: last-minute additional change in this function to allow for the 
    fact that email may be fixed in the future (post 3.2?) to split base64 data into 
    lines on its own -- if the workaround splits already-split lines, the data will 
    likely work, but will look odd.  To allow for this, inserted one line of code to
    strip newline characters if they are ever present in the data in the future; they
    are not in 3.1 or 3.2 alpha4, so this line is an unneeded but harmless no-op today:

Changed:
lines = []                           # split into lines, else 1 massive line

To:
lines = []                           # split into lines, else 1 massive line
text  = text.replace('\n', '')       # no \n present in 3.1, but futureproof me!

================

4) [Ch13, 14] Fix for SMTP pswds: mailtools MailSenderAuth, PyMailGUI WriteWindow

Store the smtp auth password on the class not self, so PyMailGUI doesn't 
ask for it on each send (for password saves, there is only ever one fetcher 
instance (use self), but one sender instance per compose window (use class)); 
changed 5 total lines, and added 1 new (class data assignment).

Changed lines:

class WriteWindow(ViewWindow, MailSenderClass):
    def onSendFail(self, exc_info, popup):
        MailSenderClass.smtpPassword = None     # try again; 3.0/4E: not self

class MailSenderAuth(MailSender):
    smtpPassword = None    # 4E: on class, not self, shared by poss N instances

    def __init__(self, smtpserver=None, smtpuser=None):
        # self.smtpPassword = None   # 4E: makes pyMailGUI ask for each send!

    def getPassword(self):
        if not self.smtpPassword:
            try:
                MailSenderAuth.smtpPassword = localfile.readline()[:-1]     # 4E
            except:
                MailSenderAuth.smtpPassword = self.askSmtpPassword()        # 4E

class MailSenderAuthConsole(MailSenderAuth):

================

5) [See changed files/dirs] 

================
